Project Description:

Sundharikku Emojithodal is a wacky Onam-themed multiplayer browser game where players pick colorful emojis and place them exactly where they think the secret ‚Äúbhindhi spot‚Äù is on a celebrity‚Äôs forehead. The twist? The image spins and vanishes before you click! Winners are crowned based on how close their emoji lands and how few ‚Äútoken points‚Äù their emoji costs ‚Äî blending festival vibes, strategy, and pure chaos into one laugh-filled Onam showdown.

The Problem (that doesn't exist):

Sundharikku Emojithodal hilariously ‚Äúdigitalizes‚Äù the art of Sundariki Pottu Thodal, bringing it into the modern Onam season with spinning celebrity heads and cheeky emoji bhindhis. Using token counts and a sprinkle of AI-style scoring logic, it scientifically determines who places the most accurate (and cost-efficient) pottu, solving a problem nobody knew existed.

The Solution (that nobody asked for):

Buy making it a fun website.
